# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
 ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:'pt-BR') do |inflect|
  inflect.plural 'Comentário', 'Comentários'
  inflect.plural 'resultado' , 'resultados'
 end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
# end
